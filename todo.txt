1. one person can give 1 unit of blood at a time and needs to wait 3 months before donating again.
   so if a receiver request for more than 1 unit, multiple donors are needed.So the request of blood
    units should be split among multiple donors.

2. the receiver should also have a history of blood donations and when the request is completed it should be recorded in the history.
    and removed the request from my requests.

3. the donor requests should also be removed from blood request on completion of donation.

4. if a donor get a request but he did not see the request so the request should be make available for the next best matching donor.
   and the request should be visible to the prev donor but if it is already taken by another donor then it should not be visible to 
   the prev donor or if he accept it should be like already accepted.and removed from his available requests.

5. this request making available to next best matching donor should be done based on the urgency of the request and the distance from the donor to the receiver.
   if the urgency is moderate or low then the request should be there for the best matching donor for 24hours/suitable time before moving to the next best matching donor.

6. if a donor reject a request then the request should be made available to the next best matching donor immediately.

1. the availability toggle of donor should be make unavailable if he completed a donation for 3 months.
